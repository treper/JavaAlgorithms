//============================================================================
//Unique Paths
//A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start'
//in the diagram below).
//
//The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot
//is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in
//the diagram below).
//
//How many possible unique paths are there?
//
//Complexity:
//DP, O(m*n) time, O(1) space
//DP, O(m*n) time, O(n) space
//Math, O(n) time, O(1) space
